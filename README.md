### Gallery

You can change different season for watching photo. All images are cashing when page downloads.
There are 24 photos. You can expand this gallery. The images are showed with animation.

### Custom video-player

There is a custom video-player. It was built by myself without any libraries. I used only Html, Sass/Scss and Javascript.
You can :

- switch on/off sound, change volume
- rewind video
- switch "all screen"
- play/stop/pause

### Slider

Swiper.js was used there and some functions were added to synchronize slider with main video. So you can
control main video with slider.

### What has been used in the project:

- _Html/Css_
- _Sass/Scss_
- _JavaScript (native)_
- _swiper.js_ (js-library)
- _Animate.css_ (animation-library)
- _Webpack (Full project is built with Webpack)_
- _Node.js v. 16.13.2_
